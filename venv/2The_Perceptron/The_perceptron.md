**THE PERCEPTRON**

* The perceptron is analogous to the biological neuron of the brain .
* The perceptron is trained to receive in the form of input nodes and transfer the appropriate output.
* It is exactly similar to how neurons works.The dendrite received electrical signal while the axon branches out to 
multiple axon terminals to send the appropriate signals many neutron  form a biological network similar to how a 
multilayer perception form a fully connected neural network.

*The back propagation that allows neural network to figure out pattern that are far too convoluted and far to complex 
for human to extract it .

**MACHINE LEARNING**
* it is the concept of building computational system that learn over time based on experience
* Machine learning uses a variety of algorithm to describe and analyze data to learn from it improve and predict useful outcomes
* Machine learning is broadly divided as SUPERVISED and UNSUPERVISED LEARNING.

    _supervised learning_
    * it is the most powerful ML technique but acts as a guide to teach the algorithm what conclusion it should come up with.
    
    * labelled dataset  ---> supervised learning algorithm ---> (New Observation -> Model -> Prediction/classification)
      
      
 ***SUPERVISED LEARNING/ linear regression***
 * linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that allow us to make prediction based on linearly arranged datasets.
 
 * for understanding better we will look into an example of a simple regression model which would model the relationship of a quantative response variable
 and the explanatory variable.
 
 * RESPONSE VARIABLE - is the dependent variable whose value we want to explain and predict based on the values 
 of the independent variable(explanatory variable)
